This is a description of the context of the app.

The main page is a portal that illustrates the following: * It is also a fallback page.
1. Vendor
" The vendor portal allows setting bids, selected trips to review,  and organizing data."
 
2. Programs
"Overview our current bids, engage with vendor data, 
and adhere to management"

3. Other
"Other Information in the portal"

Styling:
Should be bright(white colors), with dark blue and red accent, in a styling and modern way.


The Program Dashbaord:
The program dashboard should be a platform that allows for the user to enage with members and then within that construct engage with the possibility of listing and reading out critical information regarding their trips. This is improtant because the use case of this is for program directives to be able to go into and once there they should be able to go ahead and see what is the lowest bid in order to see how to effectively bid and once they effectively see the bid they need to be able to select the appropriate bid in ordr to determine who will be doing the trip for the individual member in particular this is critical because some vendors may have poor track recrods and may need to be re-evaluated in spite of being the vendor with the lowest bid. The design and aestheitcs of thsi page should refelct that. 

The Vendor Dashboard:
Archived Bids, submitted bids, and awarded contracts.
+ The ability to submit a bid and/or view details on exisiting bids.
+ the ability to search and filter down.

The forum page:
A place to illustrate --
CRM functionality needed - Click on an individual after they filter dwon to the program from the cards and it should be like a log like the top would pujll in all of the member notifications, a place for selectable trip informaiton based on tripID , when the tripID is selected it pulls up trip information, underneath that correspondance there should be the comments regarding said trip.
This can be done in a very minimal way. 

The ability to upload files is important too.
